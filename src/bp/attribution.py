covariance estimator of notebook 10; the active exposures x_t = B_t' a_t, K

the benchmark; the factor contributions x_{t,k} F_{t,k}, with F_t the factors'
returns in month t; and the residual, the active return minus the sum of the
contributions, the part of the active return the factors do not explain (the
industries' own returns). Contributions plus residual equal the active return
